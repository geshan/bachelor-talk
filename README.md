#Things I wished I knew while doing my tech bachelor/undergraduate

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/geshan/bachelor-talk.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This talk was about how to use your bachelor to craft your tech career. I started with what I have done
and some examples of where my friends have reached. Then I focused on things to consider for selecting and
doing projects for technical subjects in bachelor study.

After that I opened up the secrets of selecting a
company and doing internship. To concluded I gave some tips on approaching the job market. I think the talk
went good and I was able to convey my message correctly to all the participants. I hope the students will
benefit from it.
